## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 Phase 5]: Node.js >=18 engine requirement (minimum for built-in fetch and stable ESM)
- [v1.2 Phase 5]: Published as unscoped public package: lightdash-mcp (simplest npx invocation)
- [v1.2 Roadmap]: Two phases -- Phase 5 (package+publish) then Phase 6 (README rewrite+verification). Split because README content depends on published package name and verification depends on publish.
- [v1.1]: README written for non-engineers with dual JSON config examples
- [v1.1]: MIT license year 2025, copyright Mikhail Gasanov

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
