### v1.1 Distribution & Docs (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make the project installable by non-engineers via GitHub + beginner-friendly README.

- [ ] **Phase 4: GitHub Publication & README** - Project is publicly available on GitHub with docs that take a beginner from zero to working server

## Phase Details

### Phase 4: GitHub Publication & README
**Goal**: Anyone can discover, install, and configure the Lightdash MCP server from GitHub without help
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (working, deployed server)
**Requirements**: GH-01, GH-02, DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can find and clone the repository from GitHub (repo exists with proper .gitignore, package.json has description/keywords/license)
  2. User can follow the README from zero to a working MCP server in Claude Desktop without any external guides (covers prerequisites, PAT creation, Claude Desktop config)
  3. User can diagnose and fix common setup problems using the README troubleshooting section
  4. User can optionally configure Claude Desktop preferences for CSV table output and chart artifacts
**Plans**: TBD
